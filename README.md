👋 Hi, I'm `db2ai`

From Databases to Deep Learning
===============================

After 16+ years of experience as an Oracle DBA, I'm now on an exciting journey into Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science. I'm blending deep domain knowledge in data systems with modern predictive modeling, automation, and AI-first solutions.

What I’m Working On
====================

1) Building ML pipelines and AI-powered prototypes  
2) Learning LangChain, OpenAI APIs, and vector search with Chroma & FAISS
3) Exploring large-scale data processing with Python & SQL  
4) Integrating AI into enterprise workflows  
5) Exploring LangChain, vector databases, and RAG architectures
6) Career Pivot in Progress

This GitHub marks a fresh chapter — a pivot from managing data to empowering it. Here, you’ll find:
===================================================================================================

1) Hands-on ML/AI projects  
2) RAG and LangChain prototypes tied to blog content
3) Refactored scripts from DBA life  
4) Blog posts and notebooks documenting my learning path
