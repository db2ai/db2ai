ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Saikat â€” aka `db2ai`

ðŸŽ¯ From Databases to Deep Learning

After 16+ years of experience as an Oracle DBA, I'm now on an exciting journey into Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science. I'm blending deep domain knowledge in data systems with modern predictive modeling, automation, and AI-first solutions.

ðŸ§  What Iâ€™m Working On

Building ML pipelines and AI-powered prototypes  
Learning LangChain, OpenAI APIs, and vector search with Chroma & FAISS
Exploring large-scale data processing with Python & SQL  
Integrating AI into enterprise workflows  
Exploring LangChain, vector databases, and RAG architectures
Career Pivot in Progress

ðŸ“‚ This GitHub marks a fresh chapter â€” a pivot from managing data to empowering it. Here, youâ€™ll find:

âœ… Hands-on ML/AI projects  
âœ… RAG and LangChain prototypes tied to blog content
âœ… Refactored scripts from DBA life  
âœ… Blog posts and notebooks documenting my learning path
